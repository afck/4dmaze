{"name":"4dmaze","tagline":"A four-dimensional tile-based maze game","body":"# Yet another 4D Maze game\r\n\r\nThis is the SDL 2 port of a four-dimensional maze game I rediscovered.\r\nI had written it over a decade ago in undecipherable C ...\r\n\r\n\r\n## Build it\r\n\r\nIf you have [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) and [SDL 2](http://www.libsdl.org/)\r\ninstalled on a Linux system,\r\n``` sh\r\nmake\r\n```\r\nshould create a binary file called maze.\r\n\r\nIf that doesn't work, you will have to wait until it has a proper Makefile (or\r\nhelp me out and create one).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Understand it\r\n\r\nIf you wanted to view a building with several floors in a tile-based game on a\r\ntwo-dimensional monitor, you might show the different floors on top of each\r\nother.\r\nThus left and right on your screen would always correspond to west and east, but\r\nup and down would correspond to north and south within each floor, but to the\r\nactual elevation, the \"real up\" and \"real down\", if you move between floors.\r\nSo we'd use the vertical screen dimension twice: Moving one tile up or down\r\nmeans moving north or south within a floor, but movin up or down to a different\r\nfloor map means going up or down the stairs. We have split the meaning of the\r\nvertical dimension into two parts: \"minor up/down\" for north and south and\r\n\"major up/down\" for one floor up and one floor down, and that gave us the means\r\nto display a three-dimensional world.\r\nNow, if the building is big, we'll neither be able to show a complete floor, nor\r\nto show all the floors. We would only show the floor with the player inside it,\r\nand maybe two above and two below. And within each floor, we would only show the\r\ntile with the player on it and maybe two more rows of tiles to the north, south,\r\neast and west. If we moved the player, the view would scroll accordingly.\r\n\r\nThis game takes place in a four-dimensional world, so we do the same trick that\r\ngave us two model dimensions for the vertical screen dimension with the\r\nhorizontal screen dimension, too! You could think of it as a building where the\r\nfloors aren't numbered with just one but two numbers: From floor (0, 0) you can\r\neither go up to floor (1, 0), or you can go \"the other up\" to (0, 1).\r\n\r\nInstead of shaky metaphors with floors and buildings, however, we will just\r\nstick to what we see on the screen now and call the four dimensions\r\n\"minor horizontal\", \"major horizontal\", \"minor vertical\" and \"major vertical\".\r\n\r\nThat's almost all you need to know about the geometry of the maze: The game is\r\ntile-based, takes place in a four-dimensional hyper-rectangularly shaped grid\r\nand allows you to move in eight directions between adjacent tiles. But one more\r\nthing: The maze wraps around! That is, if you leave the maze on one side, you\r\nenter it from the other side, just like in Pac-Man. Or equivalently: On each\r\nside of the maze there's an identical copy of itself, creating an infinite\r\ntiling of the four-dimensional grid. You won't notice when you wrap around that\r\nway, though, as you are always displayed in the middle of the screen and the\r\nmaze scrolls around you.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Play it\r\n\r\nSelect a level - the provided ones should be roughly in order of difficulty, but\r\nfeel free to inspect the text files, create your own levels and send them to me!\r\n\r\nYou now see the hypercube of 5 * 5 * 5 * 5 tiles around your position: In each\r\nof the eight directions, you can see two tiles ahead. You can move around using\r\nthese keys:\r\n\r\nkey         | action\r\n------------|---------------------------------------------------------------\r\nW           | move minor-up\r\nA           | move minor-left\r\nS           | move minor-down\r\nD           | move minor-right\r\nup arrow    | move major-up\r\nleft arrow  | move major-left\r\ndown arrow  | move major-down\r\nright arrow | move major-right\r\nspace       | shuffle dimensions (i. e. rotate randomly for added confusion)\r\nescape      | exit\r\n\r\nYour goal is to reach the goal, which is shown as a rainbow-colored sphere. On\r\nyour way, you will find a few special items:\r\n\r\n* A silver key allows you to remove one silver lock.\r\n* A gold key allows you to remove one golden lock.\r\n* There are some stones that can be pushed around.\r\n* There are stone-shaped holes that can only be removed by pushing a stone into\r\n  them.\r\n* Yin-yang-shaped switches toggle whether the red or the green tiles can be\r\n  passed.\r\n\r\nGood luck, and don't get lost in hyperspace!\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
