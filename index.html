<p>This is a four-dimensional maze game you can
<a href="game.html">play in your web browser</a>.</p>


<h2>
<a id="understand-it" class="anchor" href="#understand-it" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Understand it</h2>

<p>In a two-dimensional tile-based game, you have four directions to go: north,
west, south and east. We use the W, A, S and D keys for these.</p>

<img src="images/screenshot3d.png" style="float: right"/>
<p>If the game has a third dimension, e. g. because it takes place in a building
with several floors where every tile has staircases up and down, we would display
each floor as its own grid, and stack the grids on top of each other. We use the
I and K keys to go up and down.<p>

<p>In this mode of display, the vertical <em>screen</em> dimension now
corresponds to two <em>game</em> dimensions: north/south and up/down. If you
go <em>north</em>, you go up on the screen by the height of one tile, and if you
go <em>up</em> to the next floor, you go up on the screen by the height of one
floor grid. We display <em>north</em> as "minor up", so to speak, and
<em>up</em> as "major up".</p>

<p>This game has four dimensions, so we need to display two additional
directions in which you can move, let's call them
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-dimensional_space#Orthogonality_and_vocabulary">
ana and kata
</a>. Just as above you there's a parallel floor, with one particular tile right
above your head and accessible via a staircase, there is a complete
three-dimensional parallel building ana of this one, with one tile right next to
you in the ana direction, accessible via some magic portal. And just like there
is a floor below you, there is a parallel building kata of you.</p>

<p>To display the fourth dimension, we use the same trick that allowed us to
show both north/south and up/down as the vertical screen dimension: We put the
ana parallel building on the left and the kata one on the right, so that the
horizontal screen dimension now corresponds both to east/west and to ana/kata.
"Minor left" is west, and "major left" is ana. You can move ana with J and kata
with L.</p>

<img src="images/screenshot4d.png" style="float: left"/>
<p>There's no gravity in this maze, so you don't need staircases. In fact, we
treat all four dimensions completely equally: Going up isn't more difficult than
going west. And since ana is just another direction, we don't need a magic
portal to go there - after all, you also don't need a magic portal to go north!
The tile you are standing on simply has eight directly adjacent tiles (not
diagonally!) and you can move in any of the eight directions unless an obstacle
is blocking your path.</p>

<img src="images/screenshot2dwrap.png" style="float: right"/>
<p>That's almost all you need to know about the geometry of the maze: The game is
tile-based, takes place in a four-dimensional hyper-rectangularly shaped grid
and allows you to move in eight directions between adjacent tiles. But one more
thing: The maze wraps around! That is, if you leave it on one side, you
enter it from the other side, just like in Pac-Man. You won't notice when you
wrap around that way, though, as you are always displayed in the middle of the
screen and the maze scrolls around you. If the maze is only three tiles wide in
the north/south direction, you might see the same key twice: one tile to the
north of yourself, and two tiles south of yourself. And if it is only two tiles
wide in the east/west direction, you will see the square you are standing on,
right beyond the one next to you!</p>

<a id="play-it" class="anchor" href="#play-it" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Play it</h2>

<p>Select a level - the provided ones should be roughly in order of difficulty, but
feel free to inspect the text files, create your own levels and send them to me!</p>

<p>You now see the hypercube of 5 * 5 * 5 * 5 tiles around your position: In each
of the eight directions, you can see two tiles ahead. You can move around using
these keys:</p>

<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>W</td>
<td>move minor-up</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>A</td>
<td>move minor-left</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>S</td>
<td>move minor-down</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>D</td>
<td>move minor-right</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>I</td>
<td>move major-up</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>J</td>
<td>move major-left</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>K</td>
<td>move major-down</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>L</td>
<td>move major-right</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>space</td>
<td>shuffle dimensions (i. e. rotate randomly for added confusion)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>Your goal is to reach the goal:
<span class="img blockImg" style="background-position: -336px 0px"></span>.
On your way, you will find a few special items:</p>

<ul>
<li>A silver key 
  <span class="img blockImg" style="background-position: -168px 0px"></span>
  allows you to remove one silver lock
  <span class="img blockImg" style="background-position: -224px 0px"></span>.
</li>
<li>A golden key 
  <span class="img blockImg" style="background-position: -196px 0px"></span>
  allows you to remove one golden lock
  <span class="img blockImg" style="background-position: -252px 0px"></span>.
</li>
<li>
  There are boulders
  <span class="img blockImg" style="background-position: -280px 0px"></span>
  that can be pushed around,
</li>
<li>
  and boulder-shaped holes
  <span class="img blockImg" style="background-position: -308px 0px"></span>
  that can only be removed by pushing a boulder into them.
</li>
<li>
  Switches
  <span class="img blockImg" style="background-position: -140px 0px"></span>
  toggle whether the red
  <span class="img blockImg" style="background-position: -28px 0px"></span>
  or the green tiles
  <span class="img blockImg" style="background-position: -112px 0px"></span>
  can be passed.
</li>
</ul>
